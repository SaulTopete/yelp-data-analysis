In particular, we will be placing emphasis on the use of MongoDB: a database system that stores data in a construct known as documents.

    "In lecture, we discussed how one could find specific attributes from a JSON object using dot (`.`) notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- While you can still use the dot notation in queries, PyMongo represents documents returned from Mongo queries using Python dictionaries, making it convenient to manipulate JSON using a mix of Mongo queries and array indexing. Specifically, given the result of a retrieval `find` query, you can look up the third document by indexing with `[2]`. Note, since we are using Python dictionaries, we will be using 0-based indexing. Then, given this document, you can look up the field `'amount'` by appending `['amount']` etc., adding multiple square brackets as needed to \"walk down\" the JSON tree representation via `collection.find(...)[2]['amount']`. This will return the 'amount' field from the 3rd document returned from the query. This combination of query and indexing will be useful in obtaining the necessary information you need for this question.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In order to get a visual output of the query results, you will need to wrap `collection.find(...)` inside `list()`, e.g. `list(collection.find(...))`. This is because `collection.find(...)` returns a **Cursor** object, which is an iterator. **An important consequence** is that if we set `result = collection.find(...)`, then calling `list(result)` for the first time will get you the expected list of documents in the query result, but calling `list(result)` for a second time will give you an empty list! So wrapping `collection.find(...)` directly inside `list()` would avoid this issue. With that in mind, you may not *always* need to obtain a visual output of the results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Be aware of the distinction of when you are querying with Mongo versus Python-based array indexing into your Mongo query results (i.e. you are wrapping your query inside `list()` and *then* indexing into that list.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **As a reminder, since we are using Python dictionaries as our query filter, make sure to wrap all keys and values inside quotes.**\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's learn Mongo updates, deletions, and creation. Create a new collection called `review_boolean` which is the exact same as `reviews` EXCEPT there is a new field called `to_avoid` which is the string \"true\"  if the review `text` contains the words \"disgusting\", \"horrid\", \"horrible\", \"gross\", \"bad\", or \"hate\" and the string \"false\" if not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tricky task! We have not discussed creation, updates, or insertions in great detail during lecture but luckily, Mongo uses a similar approach to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Insertions***: In order to insert into a document, you may use the functions [review_boolean.insert_one(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertOne/) or [review_boolean.insert_many(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/). These functions take in a document or a list of documents and inserts them into the collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Updates***: In order to update a document, you may use the functions [review_boolean.update_one(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateOne/) or [review_boolean.update_many(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateMany/). These functions take in two parameters. The first specifies which documents should be modified. If the first parameter is `{}`, this indicates that all documents should be updated. However, you can put a more specific filter here if you would like. The second parameter specifies what you would like to update your field to (the [$set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/set/) operator may come in handy here). Recall that in our SQL model, updates are performed as `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...`. In our case, the first ellipsis corresponds to `review_boolean`, the second ellipsis corresponds to the second parameter of `update_*` where `*` can be `one` or `many`, and the third ellipsis corresponds to the first parameter of `update_*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Creation***: We handle creation of the collection for you. But in Pymongo, creation of a collection is as simple as writing `variable_name = db[collection_name]` where db is the the Pymongo database object variable you have already created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional reminders and hints:\n",
    "- The empty collection `review_boolean` has already been created for you and is stored in the variable of the same name.\n",
    "- A text index has been created for you. You can use a similar search approach as the last question.\n",
    "- We want to start by inserting the documents from the `review` collection into the `review_boolean` collection.\n",
    "- Don't forget that in order to pass the hidden tests, the `to_avoid` field must exist for every document in `review_boolean`! The [$exists](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/exists/) operator may be helpful."

However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \\n\\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \\n\\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.\",\n",

Benefit #2: MongoDB lacking a schema style lets it have better flexibity when presenting data, and allows to show high variability throughout different documents which as explained in lecture, is common in real life data, Example #2: the two business entries show varaiabiltih in their field having different categories and attributes, and is difficult to handle in a relational database which might need to do different joins, however it is easily dealt with be accessed in Mongo."

    "One important aspect of data engineering that we have not referred to yet are joins. We saw, through the use of indices, selection/projection pushdown, and various physical implementations (as well as orderings), joins could be done quite efficiently in relational SQL based databases. How do joins fare in Mongo where the data stored is inherently semistructured? Let's investigate! For this question, we have provided you access to the tables `business_complete` and `review_complete` which contain the business and review collections in relational form as described in 2b (the columns of the relations\n",
    "are fields in the JSON document). Each relation has its respective id (`business_id` or `review_id`) column as its primary key."

However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.</td>\n",

    "In the previous question, we talked about how Mongo and Postgres approach joins. Pandas is also capable of performing joins using the [merge()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) function! For this task, perform a inner join on `business_df` with itself on `stars`. The final dataframe should be saved to a variable called `result_3b` and should only contain 3 columns in this particular order: the name of the first restaurant, the name of the second restaurant, and the number of the stars. The column names can be arbitrary.\n",

After doing some research, you find a dataset that contains a list of every single athlete at every single college and their sport and scholarship levels (this is a massive 10GB+ dataset with millions of rows). You find another dataset that contains a list of colleges, their sports programs, and the program budget. This is another massive dataset with hundreds of thousands of rows.
